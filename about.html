            <h1>About</h1>
            
            <h3>What is Autopathography?</h3>
            
            <p>Autopathography is an autobiography dealing first hand with the influence of a disease, psychological disorder, or disability on the authors life. Within our class, we looked at various artists and how they represented pathography through their respected mediums. The main focus revolves around the beautiful and intricate ways these artists express their feelings and emotions through each piece they desired to create. The creativity of these artists really brings a new perspective on art, while the various forms that can be represented are visually appealing and gripping as well.</p>
            
            <p>It’s interesting yet sad to learn about all the artists that suffer from these diseases and sicknesses and how each artist used their expertise to express their feelings. It’s intriguing how each artist represents their feelings through art. These adaptations include portraits, sculptures, stills, documentaries, and many more. Overall, autopathography represents a form of learning that should not go unnoticed. It represents the various forms in which artists represent these terrible diseases, illnesses, and psychological disorders in their own perspective and choose how to represent their emotions and feelings. Using the framework of art gives an entirely new outlook on this term and includes a visual aid that can help provide additional examples that give this term a new perspective.</p>
            
            <h3>Technology in the Art of Dying</h3>
            
            <p>Technology is a tool that can be used to keep art alive that might otherwise be lost to history. Old reels of film or taped recordings converted to digital formats and made available on digital libraries or streaming services not only preserves the art for future audiences but also makes it more accessible to people than ever before. For those artists working in the space of autopathography, this can be of utmost importance because they can be sure their art won’t die with them.</p>
            
            <p>Michel de Certeau wrote, “The dying are outcasts because they are deviants in an institution organized by and for the conservation of life” (The Practice of Everyday Life). Autopathographic art is the expression of these “outcasts” to share with the world what is happening to them, what they are going through and how they are feeling. This should be important to the living because without exception, one day, the living will become the dying outcasts. The range of emotions that follow seem confusing and hopeless but the artists who have been through it before and have captured their experience through any sort of medium can help the dying that follow to navigate the murky waters of the unknown.</p>
            
            <p>With the help of technology, Ted Rosenthal’s “How Could I Not Be Among You” can be found and viewed on the internet to help Leukemia patients and their loved ones deal with the terrible disease. Bob Flanagan’s art can help empower those with Cystic Fibrosis for years to come due to the accessibility of his work. Bas Jan Ader’s work has been converted from film reels and is now found on YouTube as well as several other online outlets and can help the depressed know they are not alone in feeling the way they feel. Just three examples out of uncountable more that, with the help of technology, can make death and dying a little easier to manage.</p>
            
            <h3>Private vs. Public</h3>
            
            <p>As a society, there has been a noticeable shift in the things we deem appropriate to make public versus what we chose to keep public to ourselves. Things that were once considered taboo and kept hush-hush are now common on people’s phone screens.The subject of death or dying is of no exception to this, more and more people are bringing death into conversation. But why is this occurring? Is is technology just making society become habitual about sharing everything? Is it a way for people suffering to gain comfort,not only from their close loved ones, but from hundreds of followers? Regardless of the reason, or if it was asked for, death is being pulled out from under the rug and into our lives.</p>
            
            <p>For centuries artists have been challenging the things hat society wanted to keep private and sometimes quite literally, putting it on display. That what makes audiences intrigued, are the things that they are not intended to be stared at or processed. Felix Gonzalez-Torres made this his legacy, taking the intimate subject of the AIDS crisis and bringing the heavy impact it had to life in his work. Torres created sculptural pieces that often required some sort of direct participation with the viewer, these occurred in a multitude of mediums, from candy to be consumed, pieces of paper to be destroyed, or curtains or beads to be walked through. Each one of these simple objects served as a canvas for the complex messages Torres was communicating about the AIDS epidemic.</p>
            
            <p>In his most public piece, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, takes the death of his lover on a public broadcast. In Untilted the image of a bed, unmade and cleary previously slept in by two people was posted on billboards in multiple locations in New York City. Torres’s lover had just died from AIDS, and instead of keeping his grief internal, he chose to publicly declare his loss. People passing by, weather by walking or driving were forced to encounter this display of death.</p>
            
            <p>By publicizing death, it becomes more familiar. This can change the perceptions of death, the ones that society has been raised on. The notions of fear and ominousness that have previously been encountered at the thought or mention of death are slowly disintegrating and being replaced by a sense of acceptance and peace with the event. Individuals who are living with a terminal illness are going online, like to Instagram or Youtube for example, and sharing their stories and their illness with all who listen or watch. Connection with others can be a sense of comfort for many people, as well as a way to educate those who are not as aware, letting these individuals suffering have a positive impact despite their situation. Some may say that this new public proclamation of death is inappropriate and insensitive. But death is a subjective topic to each person individually, so it is hard to declare a solid stance on this.</p>
      
            <h3>The Autopathographic Photograph In Our Modern Era</h3>
            
            <p>“I shall look back on my long and painful illness… as a storehouse of wild dreams for poems, or intellectual facts for metaphysical speculation.”
-Samuel Taylor Coleridge </p>
            
            <p>Autopathography, is a term that comes from literary studies it refers to a sub-genre of autobiography, in which the life (or death) narrative pivots around an experience of illness, an accident or trauma. Hence the change of the root bios to pathos. </p>
            
            <p>The tradition of Autopathographic photographs and self-portraits is not an unknown way of expression, artists like Frida Kahlo, Hannah Winkle, Jo Spence and many others  dedicated their art to the documentation of their conditions as a way to cope with the conditions that they struggled with but also the intent to show oneself as being ill or in treatment, in a path to self-acceptance and recovery but also to counter the illness lack of visibility outside the medical context.</p>
            
            <p>Among many new things that the modern era has given us, the continuous self-documentation and self-imaging has arisen especially, thanks to smart phones, image based social media and the immediacy in which information is shared.</p>
            
            <p> Because of this, representations of illness has gained an unprecedented public response. Things like the #NoMakeupSelfie trend used to help raise cancer awareness or the hashtag  #HospitalGlam used for illness activism and visibility are far away from uncommon.  
            With the usage of social media, and the global phenomenon the photographic self-documentation drifts away from being only a documentation, it is also a practice that manages to  send an immediate  message to different individuals and communities, these images end up circulating with the intent of awareness and peer education.</p>
            
            <p>The illness stops being just a subject matter for the image but it also serves publicly to picture the subjects as an individual that lives with illness, and at the same time the content is destined to circulate in social media out of the control of the original author, the self-documentation becomes social, open to appropriation and interpretation.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the Art of Dying class and Why We May Be Drawn to Death as a Topic of Discussion in General Life</h3>
            
            <p>The Art of Dying class at RIT serves to showcase the experience of dying in the view of artists who create artwork to represent their experiences during the dying period of their life. It mainly focused on diseases and how artists suffering from, say, AIDS or cancer chose to use art in order to make their personal experiences known to the world.  Each artist we cover has a unique art style, but also extremely unique way of living with their dying bodies. In some forms, these art creations also serve as a way to remember the artists that have passed, but not forget what suffering these diseases can cause in everyday lives even in the present day.</p>
            
            <p>Humans are naturally drawn to the topic of death. It is a mysterious force that we all know will eventually come to each life on the planet. Each experience of dying, the inevitable actual death where you are no longer alive, and how outsiders go through grieving that process is unique to ever person. We, as humans, are constantly trying to learn more about death and dying. We want to discover answers that no one can really give due to the fact that anyone who has experienced death is no longer with us. Dying is a painful process who those watching, but also can be a painful process for the person experiencing the dying of their own body. By trying to understand more about these topics, we also often are trying to make dying and death more comfortable for those around us; but also for ourselves when our eventual time comes to join those who have passed on.</p>
